- **Specific to the task**: The user emphasized this was the ""main blocker."" This indicates reflective knowledge and a critical task component.
- **Hard to falsify**: The user would need to have concrete knowledge of the specific ""number of positions"" adjusted and justify it. Falsifying such a detail would be difficult without truly performing the task.
- **Competence-proving**: The answer would shed light on whether the user understood the nature of the task (adjusting positions) and had encountered the necessary business logic or dataset intricacies.

Second, account quality (45%) considers total followers (30 points max) and follower-to-following ratio (15 points max). Third, every tweet gets a 15% base score. Finally, we apply time decay - posts under 6 hours get full score, declining to 50% by 42 hours. Tweets need 60+ points and 60k+ followers for replies.

An unexpected error occurred: 400 Bad Request (error code: 50035): Invalid Form Body
In data.embeds.0.fields.3.value: Must be 1024 or fewer in length.

Fix Implementation:
Added field content truncation and splitting logic to handle long messages:
1. Implemented a truncate_field function to split content when exceeding 1024 chars
2. Created multiple embed fields for longer content
3. Added proper error handling for oversized messages
